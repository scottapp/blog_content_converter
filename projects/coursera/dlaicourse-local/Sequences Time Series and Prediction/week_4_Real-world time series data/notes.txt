Exercise 4 - Sunspots - Melbourne temperature
This week you moved away from synthetic data to do a real-world prediction -- sunspots. You loaded data from CSV and built models to use it. For this week’s exercise, you’ll use a dataset from Jason Brownlee, author of the amazing MachineLearningMastery.com site and who has shared lots of datasets at https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets. It’s a dataset of daily minimum temperatures in the city of Melbourne, Australia measured from 1981 to 1990.  Your task is to download the dataset, parse the CSV, create a time series and build a prediction model from it. Your model should have an MAE of less than 2, and as you can see in the output, mine had 1.78. I’m sure you can beat that! :)
